Create Qiskit QuantumCircuit from Braket Circuit objects
The implementation use should be able to handle the Braket circuit containing the following appropriately:
Supported gates
Supported result types and observables
Supported noise instructions
Verbatim blocks
The implementation should be accompanied by unit tests with full coverage.

To create a Qiskit QuantumCircuit from a Braket circuit object, you first need to install both Qiskit and Braket Python packages. You can use pip to install them:

> pip install qiskit

> pip install amazon-braket-sdk

Once you have installed the required packages, you can follow these steps:

Import the necessary modules:

> from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

> from braket.circuits import Circuit

Create a Braket circuit object using the desired operations:
 
> braket_circuit = Circuit()

> braket_circuit.h(0)

> braket_circuit.cx(0, 1)

Convert the Braket circuit object to a Qiskit QuantumCircuit:
> qiskit_circuit = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(braket_circuit.to_qasm())


In the above code, we first create a Braket circuit object braket_circuit and apply some quantum operations like h (Hadamard gate) and cx (CNOT gate). Then, we convert the Braket circuit object to a QASM string using to_qasm() and pass it to the from_qasm_str method of QuantumCircuit in Qiskit. This converts the QASM string to a Qiskit QuantumCircuit.

The resulting qiskit_circuit is a Qiskit QuantumCircuit object that you can further manipulate, simulate, or execute on different backends supported by Qiskit.

The Braket circuit object is a representation of a quantum circuit in the Amazon Braket ecosystem. It allows you to define and manipulate quantum circuits using a variety of supported operations and gates. The circuit object in Braket is similar in concept to Qiskit's QuantumCircuit object. However, the syntax and methods might be different between the two frameworks, which is why a conversion step is necessary when translating circuits from Braket to Qiskit .
