Create Qiskit QuantumCircuit from Braket Circuit objects
The implementation use should be able to handle the Braket circuit containing the following appropriately:
Supported gates
Supported result types and observables
Supported noise instructions
Verbatim blocks
The implementation should be accompanied by unit tests with full coverage.
